This was the autoup bot used on the old MTV. Hopefully it can be modified it to work for Nebulance.

We would required the Bot to be able to:

- Auto download via RSS/autodl-irssi
- Create the mediainfo and torrent
- Auto upload and seed it on Nebulance

It would be really helpful if a detailed install guide was also written and added to the Wiki.
