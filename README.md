# Hydra

This was the autoup bot used on the old MTV. Hopefully it can be modified it to work for Nebulance. While there has been some work done it isn't complete.

We would required the Bot to be able to:

- Auto download via RSS/autodl-irssi
- Create the mediainfo and torrent
- Auto upload and seed it on Nebulance

It would be really helpful if a detailed install guide was also written and added to the Wiki.
